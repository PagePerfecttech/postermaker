## üîß Environment Variables Setup

For any deployment platform, you'll need these environment variables:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_random_string_here
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

## üì± PWA Deployment Considerations

### HTTPS Requirement
- PWAs require HTTPS to function properly
- All major deployment platforms provide HTTPS by default
- Service workers and app installation only work over HTTPS

### Domain Configuration
- Update your Supabase project settings to allow your deployment domain
- Add your domain to the allowed origins list in Supabase

### Cache Headers
- The deployment configurations include proper cache headers for PWA assets
- Service worker and manifest files have appropriate content types set

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

1. **Create Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Note down your project URL and API keys

2. **Run Database Schema**
   - Go to the SQL editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
   - Execute the SQL to create tables

3. **Create Admin User**
   - Run the migration script locally first:
     ```bash
     node migrate-data.js
     ```
   - Or manually insert admin user in Supabase dashboard

## üß™ Testing Deployment

After deployment, test these features:

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Visit your deployed URL
   - Test template loading and poster generation
   - Verify admin panel access

2. **PWA Features**
   - Check if the app can be installed (look for install prompt)
   - Test offline functionality
   - Verify service worker registration in browser dev tools

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Test on actual mobile devices
   - Verify responsive design
   - Check touch interactions

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Variables Not Loading**
   - Verify all variables are set in your deployment platform
   - Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Redeploy after adding variables

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
   - Check if your deployment domain is allowed in Supabase settings
   - Ensure database schema has been applied

3. **PWA Not Installing**
   - Verify HTTPS is enabled (should be automatic on all platforms)
   - Check manifest.json is accessible at `/manifest.json`
   - Ensure service worker is registered without errors

4. **File Upload Issues**
   - For serverless deployments, consider using cloud storage (Supabase Storage, Cloudinary, etc.)
   - Update file upload logic to use cloud storage instead of local filesystem

## üìä Performance Optimization

### For Production Deployment

1. **Enable Compression**
   - Most platforms enable gzip compression by default
   - Verify in network tab that responses are compressed

2. **CDN Configuration**
   - Static assets are automatically served via CDN on most platforms
   - Consider using a separate CDN for uploaded images

3. **Database Optimization**
   - Enable connection pooling in Supabase
   - Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed data

## üîê Security Checklist

- [ ] Change default admin credentials
- [ ] Use strong JWT secret
- [ ] Enable RLS (Row Level Security) in Supabase
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Monitor for security vulnerabilities

## üìà Monitoring

Consider adding monitoring for:
- Application uptime
- Error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics
- Database performance

## üöÄ Continuous Deployment

Most platforms support automatic deployment from GitHub:
1. Connect your repository
2. Enable automatic deployments
3. Every push to main branch will trigger a new deployment

This ensures your live site stays updated with your latest changes.
